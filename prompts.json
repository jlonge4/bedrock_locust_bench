    "text": "Analyze the following business scenario and provide strategic recommendations:\n\nA mid-sized technology company is experiencing rapid growth in their cloud infrastructure services. Over the past 18 months, they've seen a 300% increase in customer base, expanding from 500 to 2000 enterprise clients. However, this growth has created several operational challenges:\n\n1. Infrastructure Scaling: Their current data center capacity is reaching 85% utilization, and provisioning new hardware takes 8-12 weeks.\n\n2. Team Capacity: The engineering team has grown from 50 to 120 people, but they're struggling with coordination, communication breakdowns, and inconsistent development practices across teams.\n\n3. Customer Support: Support ticket volume has increased 400%, with average resolution time growing from 4 hours to 16 hours. Customer satisfaction scores have dropped from 4.5/5 to 3.2/5.\n\n4. Technical Debt: To meet aggressive feature delivery deadlines, the team has accumulated significant technical debt. System reliability has decreased from 99.9% to 98.5% uptime.\n\n5. Market Competition: Three new competitors have entered the market with similar offerings and aggressive pricing strategies, putting pressure on margins.\n\nThe company has $15M in annual recurring revenue, $8M in operational costs, and $25M in venture funding. The leadership team needs to make critical decisions about:\n- Whether to invest in expanding physical infrastructure or migrate to a hybrid cloud model\n- How to restructure engineering teams for better efficiency\n- Whether to raise additional funding or focus on profitability\n- How to improve customer retention while managing support costs\n- Which product features to prioritize given limited engineering resources\n\nProvide a comprehensive analysis covering immediate priorities, resource allocation, organizational structure recommendations, and a 12-month roadmap. Consider technical, financial, and human factors in your recommendations. Include potential risks and mitigation strategies for each major recommendation.",
